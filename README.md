# ratbox-monitor
ratbox-monitor is intended to be an updated re-write of dronemon.pl.  Ultimately, we expect it to be a superset of dronemon and BOPM's original features.  

Here are a few of the planned features and design goals:

* event/handler driven code framework
* multiprocess support
* multiple platform support
* SSL support
* asynchronous queue-based I/O for: socket writes, DNSBL lookups, bans, and maybe more...
* JSON configuration and long-term data storage
* DNSBL support
* modular and easily extensible
* improved internal data integrity over the original dronemon
* significant performance improvements over the original dronemon
* transparency and curated code

It is in a very early stage as of this writing and not yet suitable to do anything useful.  In fact, its current status is essentially an incomplete framework to support the planned features and design goals.

More to come!
